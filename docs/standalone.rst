Standalone Usage
================

The aim of the Kernel Management is to be integrated in larger application such as the :ref:`Jupyter Server <server>`.

Although, it can be used a standalone module to, for example, launch a :ref:`Kernel Finder <kernel_finder>`
from the command line and get a list of :ref:`Kernel Specifications <kernelspecs>`

.. code-block:: python

    python -m jupyter_kernel_mgmt.discovery
